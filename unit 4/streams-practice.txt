1. Create a Dart function named primeGenerator that generates prime numbers indefinitely using a sync generator. 
2. Implement an async generator function called fetchData that simulates fetching data asynchronously. It takes a list of URLs as input and yields the contents of each URL after a simulated delay of 1 second. Use asynchronous functions for simulating the delay and fetching data. Test your function by printing the contents of each URL fetched.
3. Create a Dart program that generates a stream of integers from 1 to 10 using a StreamController. Then, transform this stream to double each value and print the result. Ensure that the transformation is performed asynchronously.
4. Write a Dart program that demonstrates proper subscription management for a stream. Generate a stream of random numbers every second and subscribe to it. After 10 seconds, cancel the subscription. Ensure that the program stops receiving updates from the stream after canceling the subscription.
